\chapter*{Acknowledgements}


There are a number of people I need to thank for their help and support throughout this project: first and foremost, Matko Bo\v{s}njak, for his tireless patience and guidance; secondly Sebastian Riedel for his thoughtful advice and interest in the project; also friends, family and the rest of UCL Machine Reading. 

Also, thanks to the Whiney Beaches, for making it fun.
