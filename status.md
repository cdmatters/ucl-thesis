Intro - 2hrs
Backhground - 4hr




Back prop first
Mention non neural network models for background
Evaluate
Differnet tokenizations of code not straightforward, look at other tokenizations papers




### Introduction

* State a problem and a possible solution to it
* List of contributions and refer to contributions

### Dataset

* Motivation
    - literature review covers existing dataset.
    
    - what we want from this task (close alignmeny of code to words, real syntax trees), to solve this task we need this dataset. currently what waee havee doesnt exists. motivate the necessity of collecting the dataset. refer to literature review. why do we need to collect
* only cite numbers of other statistical datasets
* then method collection
* datapointexamples. summarise and put up
* move 4.1 to appendix. (fields as in dataset)
* think about representing 4.2
* table 4.4 rejig
* move arguments per function to code
* no analysis on rest of docstring since not focus, and therea re other corpus for that probably 
* cloc, & also tree width (pip python code stats)
* Random Split, Library Split
* Comparing Random Split to Library split
        + Variable names not in dev set 
        + tfidf
