\chapter{Hashtable Baselines Note}
\label{baselines_note}

\textit{This is a note to explain the current situation of the project, and to decide what might need doing in the last few weeks of the project. 
I'm aware I have a lot of different ways of chopping the data set, and differnet models, so there is potential to investigate a lot.}

\section{The Dataset} % (fold)
\label{sec:the_dataset}

The raw dataset is the set of all functions that obey the \mintinline{python}{numpy} or \mintinline{python}{google} standard of docstrings, from top 300 libraries as available on \mintinline{python}{pip}. 
These were collected by writing an extension to the \mintinline{python}{sphinx} documentation generator, which is the industry standard for automatic code documentation.

In terms of the amount of data collected:
\begin{itemize}
    \item 133 libraries contributied to dataset
    \item 12,079 function definitions were collected
    \item 39,205 (argument, description) pairs were collected
\end{itemize}

In examining this data, I found there data to be 
\begin{itemize}
    \item heavily biased towards scientific libraries
    \item to have a number of duplicates of (argument, description) pairs
\end{itemize}
